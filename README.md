![Hi](https://github.com/Hera-Moon/My-rabbit-Zsh-Theme/assets/165302812/bf5f8534-675d-4630-9054-a6de81956129)

A ZSH theme optimized for people who use:

- Git
- Unicode-compatible fonts and terminals (I use iTerm2 + Menlo)


# Compatibility

**NOTE:** In all likelihood, you will need to install a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) for this theme to render correctly.

## What does it show?

- the virtual environment.
- Working directory
- Git status



## Future Work

1. Elevated (root) privileges (âš¡)
2. Represent python version 
3. Represent virtual environment name

Please recommend me what feature should I improve.
It would be nice for the code to be a bit more sane and re-usable.
